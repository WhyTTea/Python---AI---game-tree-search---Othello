#In 100-250 words, answer the question: what did I learn in the games unit?

The games module assignment presented me with a few points of struggle. Conceptually everything was clear, but when it came down to the implementation 
I had myself wondering in a few scenarios. Regardless of that, I picked up a huge amount of interesting information thanks to the fact that I was able 
to put my knowledge to the test with this task to challenge my understanding of this module. 
Firstly, I realized that comparing alpha with beta is actually "greater/lesser or equal" rather than a strict inequality. Fixing this bug alone sped up 
my pruning about 3 times.
Secondly, I was amazed by the difference in time execution when we introduced the limit parameter. I am becoming a huge fan of iterative deepening technique
the more I work on anything that involves some sort of tree in data structure.
Thirdly, and rather unsurprisingly, I was made aware that the concept of caching is very useful and the AI field is no exception to this. Especially thanks 
to the fact that we have ADTs (e.g. dictionaries/hashmaps) that help us locate information in O(1). 
In addition to the aforementioned, I realized that the concept of heuristic in this context is rather different from what we learned in the search module. 
And the fact that I did not re-adjust myself to the new context made me waste a lot of time while designing my heuristic function.
